# Linux Kernel Development Analysis
This project aims to analyze the development history of the Linux kernel, a famous open-source project that serves as the heart of some popular Linux distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu or CentOS.

## Overview
We will be analyzing almost 13 years (early 2005 - late 2017) of kernel development history. The dataset used contains every change made to the source code, including the date, the responsible developer, and a brief message that describes the intention of the change.

The main objectives of this project are:

Identifying the TOP 10 contributors to the Linux kernel development.
Visualizing the number of commits over the years.
## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used to perform the analysis:

Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas library
Matplotlib library
## Results
The analysis produced the following results:

TOP 10 contributors to the Linux kernel development:

Linus Torvalds
David S. Miller
Takashi Iwai
Al Viro
H. Peter Anvin
Ingo Molnar
Greg Kroah-Hartman
Mauro Carvalho Chehab
Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo
Paul E. McKenney
Visualization of the number of commits over the years.

## Conclusion
The analysis of the Linux kernel development history provides valuable insights into the work of the development efforts. The identified TOP 10 contributors and the visualization of commits over the years demonstrate the collaborative and continuous nature of open-source software development.
